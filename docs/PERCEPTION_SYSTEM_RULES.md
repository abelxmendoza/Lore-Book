# Perception System Rules

## Hard Contract (System-Level Rule)

**Lorebook records how I experienced and interpreted my life—not the objective truth of others.**

This rule is enforced at every level:
- Schema naming
- UI language
- AI prompts
- Validation logic

## Core Principles

### 1. Perception vs Experience Gate

**What**: When creating an entry, the system asks (or infers):
- Did you experience this directly?
- Or did you hear/assume it?

**Why**: Prevents accidental misclassification when emotional or ranting. Most "gossip" happens fast—this gate slows it just enough to keep things clean.

**Default**: Ambiguous inputs → `perception_entry`.

### 2. Impact on Me (Required Field)

**What**: Every perception entry must answer:
- How did believing this affect my actions, emotions, or decisions?

**Why**: Shifts focus away from others. Reframes gossip as decision input, not drama. Even false beliefs can have real consequences—this captures that.

**Outcome**: Cleaner ethics, better self-analysis, stronger future AI insights.

### 3. Belief Evolution Tracking

**What**: Perception entries can be:
- Updated with resolution (confirmed, disproven)
- Annotated later with reflections
- Original text is preserved

**Why**: People grow. Beliefs change. This stops you from gaslighting your past self or rewriting history.

**Outcome**: You track change, not just mistakes. Lorebook tells a story of learning.

### 4. Soft Language Enforcement

**What**: UI and AI rewrite suggestions:
- "X is a liar" → "I believed X was lying"

**Why**: Language shapes memory. This protects you from turning beliefs into "facts" subconsciously.

**Outcome**: Lorebook stays psychologically safe. Your writing becomes more precise over time.

### 5. Person Sensitivity Flags

**What**: Mark people as:
- `public` (default)
- `private`
- `sensitive`

Sensitive people require:
- Extra confirmation before adding perceptions
- Lower default confidence

**Why**: Some names carry weight (exes, coworkers, rivals). This stops emotional dumping from becoming permanent narrative damage.

**Outcome**: You stay ethical without censoring yourself. Less regret later.

### 6. Cool-Down Review Mode

**What**: Perception entries created in high-emotion mode get:
- A reminder after X days (default: 7)
- A prompt to review, retract, or resolve

**Why**: Gossip is often emotional noise. Time reveals clarity.

**Outcome**: Lorebook evolves with you. Less emotional debt stored long-term.

## Timeline Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### What Perception Entries CAN Do
- Belong to your timelines
- Be filtered by era ("College", "Solar", etc.)
- Be linked to memories

### What They CANNOT Do
- Anchor timelines
- Define eras
- Act as factual events
- Be auto-promoted to memory

**Timeline anchoring is exclusive to lived experience.**

## Visual Treatment (Mandatory)

Perception entries use:
- **Color**: Desaturated / muted
- **Icon**: 👁️ / 🫧 / 🕯️ (something unstable)
- **Opacity**: 80% default
- **Badges**: "Unverified", "Secondhand", "Belief at the time", "Retracted" (red + strikethrough)

## Copy Rules

**Never say:**
- "X did Y"

**Always say:**
- "I believed X did Y"
- "I heard that X did Y"

This isn't moral—it's defensive clarity.

## Absolute Red Lines (System Enforced)

🚫 No objective claims about others without perception framing
🚫 No people-owned timelines unless marked fictional
🚫 No automatic "truth promotion"
🚫 No retroactive rewriting without trace

If any of these happen, Lorebook stops being safe.

## Mental Lock-In (Keep This)

You are not writing other people's lore.

You are writing:
- The record of how other people existed in your mind and life over time.

That's honest.
That's human.
That's defensible.
